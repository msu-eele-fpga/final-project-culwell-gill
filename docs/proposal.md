# Final project proposal

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Two buttons will control a running LED on the 8 FPGA LEDs. The two buttons will change the direction of the LED (left, right). The software will read the inputs of the buttons and manage the output to the LED array.   

## Hardware/software proposal 2
A dip switch will control an LED on the FPGA. The first four switches on the DIP switch will correspond to a binary number which will be the amount of times that the LED will blink when a button is pressed. The software will act as a middle man reading the inputs of the switches and the press of the button. The Software will also control the LED output.  

## Extra credit

A button will invert the LED array in proposal 1.

A button increases the blinking speed of the LED in proposal 2 each time it is pressed.
